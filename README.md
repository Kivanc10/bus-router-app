# bus-router-app
### - This app is designed for buses to adjust their routes according to the population of passengers in certain stations. The app tries to find the most suitable path that has a small cost and much passengers as possible.
### - This app uses an adjacency matrix and warshall-Floyd algorithm to lead users to find the most suitable and short paths for their destinations.
### - This app's backend section has been designed with Golang. It provides every endpoint the app can need such as sign-in/up for admin and user, adding or removing new station point

| <img src="/images/3.jpg" style="width:180px;height:350px" /> |<img src="/images/4.jpg" style="width:180px;height:350px" />  | These pages are represent register and login page, user can login or register to use app|
| <img src="/images/5.jpg" style="width:180px;height:350px" /> |<img src="/images/6.jpg" style="width:180px;height:350px" />  | The algorithm calculates the path that the user can follow with help of the adjacency matrix |

- ### The last section of images represents the result of the destination belonging to the user. The user wants to go from Karam√ºrsel to Gebze and the algorithm shows the path calculated by algorithm based on the adjacency matrix. This path is the most suitable and short path based on the matrix.
